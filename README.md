# Natural-Language-Processing-Nanodegree
Winning Octahacks meant a full scholorship to any one of Udacity's Nanodegree. With my projects stacked on Computer Vision, I thought it was the perfect time for take a dive into quality Natural Language Processing. Having previously done NLP courses they were pretty sueperficial. I find this course showing much more detail and great effort to push forward research. The project contains 3 projects
1) Hidden Markov Model Implementation from Scratch 
2) Machine Translation 
3) Alexa Skill Development. 

Stay tuned :) this is going to be one hell of a journey!
